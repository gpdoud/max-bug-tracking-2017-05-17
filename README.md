# Bug Tracking Project

## Overview
The Bug Tracking Project is an exercise to allow students to experience working as a team on a single project. There will be a single repository (the instructor will own this) and the length of time will be no more than one week.

There is no expectation that the entire project will be completed within the one week time horizon. The goal is to get a working version of the software regardless of the number of features that are or are not included.
